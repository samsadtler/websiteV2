	Whears is a device which enables its wearer to sense the direction of a loved one or place of interest through the use of vibration. The user enters a location through their smartphone and connects to the device through Bluetooth. When a location is entered the user receives a vibration on their wrist when they are facing the direction of that place. Thus enabling them to be reminded of that place throughout the day and have a constant reference point for when they are navigating. Or they can just change the location when they need to get to a new location.
