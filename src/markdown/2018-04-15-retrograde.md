Retrograde was an exploration into the connection of A.I. assistants and their relationship to life’s existential questions i.e. “What is the meaning of life?,” “What happens when we die?,” “Are we just a brain in a jar connected to the Internet a.k.a. Are we in the matrix?” By helping the assistants better understand these questions, should they not in turn, help answer those questions for the rest of society?

This work came out of a Second Sunday's Tech Take Over at <a href="https://pioneerworks.org/residency/sam-sadtler/">Pioneer Works </a> and was continued during a 3 month Tech Residency there. The work utilizes two custom made skills for both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa utilizing Google Firebase and AWS Lambda respectively.
